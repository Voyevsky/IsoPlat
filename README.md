# IsoPlat

(solo project)
3D platformer with isometric view

# Goals


**-create and fine-tune character movement(playable with both keyboard and controller) (~2 weeks)**
* Movement includes moving the character with WASD and analog stick, jumping, dashing

**-create simple combat mechanics (~1-2 weeks)**
* Includes basic melee attack, as well as simple magic spells

**-create an interface (~2 weeks)**
* Includes health bar, mana bar, energy for dashing and strong attacks, as well as spell selection and pause menu.

**-create character sprites(~2 weeks)**
* While the game will have a 3D world, it will use flat character sprites oriented towards the camera at all times. An orthographic camera will be used in order to make it all look like it belongs together.

**-create a demonstrative level for showing off mechanics (~2-3 weeks)**

* In order to show off the mechanics, the level will need terrain of varying height to create playground for platforming mechanics. The level also needs enemies placed in various locations, with some of them being in areas only reachable with magic.
